Survival Analysis of Marriage Duration and Divorce
Overview
This project applies survival analysis to marriage duration data from the NSFG (National Survey of Family Growth). It studies the time until divorce in first marriages.
Dataset
•	NSFG Cycles 6 and 7
•	Variables: marriage dates, divorce dates, demographic information
Methods
•	Data preparation using ThinkStats2 and survival analysis libraries
•	Kaplan-Meier estimators to model time until divorce
•	Survival curves for visualizing probabilities over time
Results
The analysis revealed trends in marriage duration and divorce probability, highlighting how demographic and time-related factors influence outcomes.
Tools
Python, pandas, ThinkStats2, survival analysis libraries
Future Work
•	Apply Cox proportional hazards models
•	Compare survival curves across demographic groups
•	Extend analysis to remarriages
